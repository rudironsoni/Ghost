# Project Overview

## General Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use meaningful comments for complex business logic

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use double quotes for strings
- Use trailing commas in multi-line objects and arrays

## Architecture Principles

- Organize code by feature, not by file type
- Keep related files close together
- Use dependency injection for better testability
- Implement proper error handling
- Follow single responsibility principle

# Agent Guidance: dotnet-skills

IMPORTANT: Prefer retrieval-led reasoning over pretraining for any .NET work.
Workflow: skim repo patterns -> consult dotnet-skills by name -> implement smallest-change -> note conflicts.

Routing (invoke by name)
- C# / code quality: modern-csharp-coding-standards, csharp-concurrency-patterns, api-design, type-design-performance
- ASP.NET Core / Web (incl. Aspire): aspire-service-defaults, aspire-integration-testing, transactional-emails
- Data: efcore-patterns, database-performance
- DI / config: dependency-injection-patterns, microsoft-extensions-configuration
- Testing: testcontainers-integration-tests, playwright-blazor-testing, snapshot-testing

Quality gates (use when applicable)
- dotnet-slopwatch: after substantial new/refactor/LLM-authored code
- crap-analysis: after tests added/changed in complex code

Specialist agents
- dotnet-concurrency-specialist, dotnet-performance-analyst, dotnet-benchmark-designer, akka-net-specialist, docfx-specialist
